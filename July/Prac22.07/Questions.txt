Basic Operators
Arithmetic Operators:

Write a Java program that takes two integers as input and prints their sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder.
Increment and Decrement Operators:

Explain the difference between the postfix and prefix increment operators with an example.
Relational Operators:

Write a program to compare two integers and print whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.
Ternary and Conditional Operators
Ternary Operator:

Write a Java program that takes an integer input and uses the ternary operator to print whether the number is even or odd.
Nested Ternary Operator:

Use nested ternary operators to determine the largest of three numbers.
Logical Operators
Logical AND and OR:

Write a program that checks if a given year is a leap year. Use logical AND and OR operators in the condition.
Logical NOT:

Write a program that takes a boolean input and prints its negation using the logical NOT operator.
Bitwise Operators
Bitwise AND, OR, XOR:

Write a program that performs bitwise AND, OR, and XOR operations on two integers and prints the results.
Bitwise Shift Operators:

Write a program to demonstrate the use of left shift (<<), right shift (>>), and unsigned right shift (>>>) operators on an integer.
Advanced Problems
Combining Logical and Bitwise Operators:

Write a program that takes two integers and prints whether both numbers are odd using both logical and bitwise operators.
Using Ternary and Bitwise Operators:

Use the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive, negative, or zero, and then use bitwise operators to set the appropriate bits in a status flag.
Conditional Statements with Logical Operators:

Write a program that checks if a given character is a vowel or consonant using conditional statements and logical operators.
